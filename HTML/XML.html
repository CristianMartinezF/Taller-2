    <h1>What is XML?</h1>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"></ul>
    <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <Strong>M</Strong>arkup <Strong>L</Strong>anguage</li>
    <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML</li>
    <li>XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
    <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
    <li>XML uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong> (DTD) or an <strong>XML Schema</strong> to describe the
        data</li>
    <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li>

    <h2>The main difference between XML and HTML</h2>

    <p><strong>XML was designed to carry data.</strong></p>
    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML</p>
    <p>XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>
    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is </p>
    <p>HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>
    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

    <h3>XML does not DO anything</h3>
    <p><strong>XML was not designed to DO anything.</strong></p>
    <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything XML was created to structure, store and to
        send information.</p>
    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p>

        <img src="../RECURSOS/IMAGENES/taller2.png" alt="">
        
    <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information But still, this XML
        document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped in XML tags: Someone must write a piece of
        software to send, receive or display it.</p><br><br>
